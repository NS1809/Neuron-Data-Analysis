# Neuron-Data-Analysis
R Shiny app for analyzing data from NEURON simulations with complex models.  

### How to use  
Before starting [app.r](https://github.com/joey-kilgore/Neuron-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Neuron-Shiny/app.R) place data generated by saving all parameters from the [Nerve-Block-Modeling Repository](https://github.com/joey-kilgore/Nerve-Block-Modeling) into the [data folder](https://github.com/joey-kilgore/Neuron-Data-Analysis/tree/master/Neuron-Shiny/Data).  
When app.r is run, it will load up various parameter from the dataset, and then combine them in a dataframe. This is done with code that already existed in the [Nerve-Block-Modeling/R Code](https://github.com/joey-kilgore/Nerve-Block-Modeling/tree/master/R%20Code). From here you can then select variables and colors to begin plotting.  
Use the generate button to update the plot window when you have selected the parameters you wish to plot.  
Use the keep button if you want to take the current parameters you have set and save them for layering another plot on top. This is similar to the [hold on](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/hold.html) functionality in MATLAB.  
Use the clear button when you want to remove all previous layers of the plot. This does not update the plot window, but the next time you generate a plot it will be generated from a blank state.
